  /*
 * Program written by: Joseph Phan
 * File Name: optimize
 * File Description: Given a Database, this program will find the top K sets under the given error accuracy
 * that gives the greatest objective function outputs:
 *
 * How data is stored:
 * 		Each row is a transaction. The first element of a row will represent the frequency of occurrence of
 * 		that transaction. Each item is separated by a space. There will no spaces in the beginning or end of
 * 		a transaction.
 *
 * Terminology:
 * item = one value or element from a transaction
 * transaction = one set of items or a "row" in the database.
 * possible points = number of elements in a transaction that can possibly contribute to increase the value
 *
 * Process:
 * 1) Reads in database from a text file and saves the data needed. note that data must
 *    be stored in a certain format. first value is number of occurrences of the transactions
 *    followed by a space and then the transaction is next. each item should be separated by a space
 *
 * 2) Saves data from the text file - frequency of each item, location each item occurs, number of transactions
 *    and number of unique values and then sort all items highest number of occurrences to lowest number of
 *    occurrences in an array
 *
 * 3) Performs Depth first search type algorithm and proning to search through possible sets
 *
 * 4) At each addition of a new element, the search process first finds the new objective function output
 * 	  determines which transactions will never improve the objective function output and removes them. Then performs
 * 	  an upper bound calculation to determine whether or not the search process should continue down in a depth manner
 *
 * 5) After search complete, this program will display the results.
