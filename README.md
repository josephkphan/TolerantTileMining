### Overview
This program can determine the top trends from a store given a database on their transactions. It can find number of specified top trends (ex: the top 10) or the top trends with exactly 5 items

### Reason for research
Many stores nowadays sell by their "Top 10 most sold" or advertise by their frequent items. Using this program, stores can broaden their outlook in advertisement.
